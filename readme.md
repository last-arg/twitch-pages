## Routing
[Alpine routing](https://github.com/alpinejs/alpine/issues/306#issuecomment-627400322)
Non-hash (pathname) variant should be possible also
[Htmx routing](https://htmx.org/attributes/hx-push-url/)
hx-push-url should probably be used with [hx-history-elt](https://htmx.org/attributes/hx-history-elt/)


## TODO
* Make own script of htmx without global factory. Problem is as soon htmx is loaded it is also started.
