# Twitch alternative page
Use twitch API to display simple alternatives to some twitch pages.
Pages:
* Top games
* Category/Game
* User videos
* Settings (non-twitch api page)

## TODO
[ ] format js
[ ] use @layer to order css (during build process)
  [ ] can add/append to layers ('@layer components {}'). Do this inside webc files.
  Because I don't like the order webc uses for CSS.
[ ] how to get css just for src/partials/*.webc
[ ] look if I can use something from here https://github.com/Set-Creative-Studio/cube-boilerplate/tree/main
[ ] Use cache API for partials
- See what is going on with site responsiveness
  - firefox vertical tabs: right side of the site is hidden
