## Routing
[Alpine routing](https://github.com/alpinejs/alpine/issues/306#issuecomment-627400322)
Non-hash (pathname) variant should be possible also
[Htmx routing](https://htmx.org/attributes/hx-push-url/)
hx-push-url should probably be used with [hx-history-elt](https://htmx.org/attributes/hx-history-elt/)
Swapping multiple elements in htmx with hx-swap-oob (response text contains the attribute)


## TODO
* Make own script of htmx without global factory. Problem is as soon htmx is loaded it is also started.
* Explore options for html over the wire: htmx, twinspark.js, ...
* Could implement html over the wire in alpine?
* Scroll shadows
  * [Example 3](https://codepen.io/chris22smith/pen/OJMrWgb)
* Accessiblity
* Sidbar close button pressed -> move focus back to button that opened it.
